# Introduction

Product Badges integration can be quite simple! The simplest way is to replace the `sale-flash.php` Woo template. Don't worry, the plugin does this automatically :-)

Sometimes, this template isn't available and then we can hook the plugin onto Woo actions to display the proper badge template. This way of integrating the plugin is handy when you don't want to replace your current sale and out of stock badges, but would rather just add some new badges to your products.

## Let's start!

First let's choose what we want to do with the badges in our shop. If you'd rather completly replace your theme badges we suggest using the default installation method, which is to replace the `sale-flash.php`. Navigate [Woo Template Integration](./woo-template) to learn which plugin option is activated for this installation.

If you'd rather add badges on top of your existing theme badges we suggest using the `Init Action` options. Navigate [Actions and hooks](./actions-hooks) to learn more about this integration.
