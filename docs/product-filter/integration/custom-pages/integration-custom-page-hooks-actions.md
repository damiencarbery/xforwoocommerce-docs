# Actions and hooks

This integration is also possible for custom pages. But, it is very advanced, and we'll not cover it here. Neither will our support.

The ability to use hooks and actions is not reserved only for the Shop page, but for any page.

So, if you know what you're building you can use hooks and actions to display the Product Filter, then you're free to use the `[products]` shortcode with appropriate attributes to activate the Product Filter.
