# Integration

Usually this is an additional installation, e.g. if you use a custom page to display some particular products and you would like to have a filter with the products grid there, surely.

Some devs create all custom pages even for the archives. This is a bit wrong, but we cannot stop it from happening.

To cover all these use cases Product Filter works with the advanced WooCommerce shortcode `[products]`.

These principles can be used with any page builder for WordPress. You can use the `[products]` shortcode on any page, within any page builder, like Elementor or WPBakery Page Builder or even Gutenberg, simply use the shortcode element from that particular builder.

This is the most correct way to show your products on custom pages. Always use the official WooCommerce `[products]` shortcode. Performance and compatibility wise, this is your best choice.
