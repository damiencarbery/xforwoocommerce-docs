5. **Select Box** - HTML5 select box

7. **Live Select** - Live select box, an input with typed in values and search results for terms

## List (Default)

List looks like a one columned table having rows of checkboxes and terms. When a term is clicked it'll be marked as active. Term checkbox will appear checked and title will go bold.

Lists can be in two, three columns or can have inline terms. Lists can have hierarchy, multiselect, term count and more.

## Button

If you don't want to use checkboxes and need some buttons instead, use this style type. Buttons have configurable display and style and can easily adjust to your website style.

Buttons can be set to two, three columns or can be inline. Buttons support hierarchy fully, but display is more efficient with lists. Multiselect, term count and more are available for any display type, so for buttons too.

## Color Swatch

Color swatches are ususaly used for color attributes. They are configured with a color option. Design can be square or rounded, and you can set the size of the swatch. Interestin option is to activate `Show labels`. That way colors will not be shown as inline swatches, but more like a block list of colors with their names.

Colors are usualy square ratio, but you can choose two or three columned filter to get them to that size. Multiselect, term count and more are available for any display type, so here too.

## Thumbnail Swatch

Thumbnails are very versitile. Use any images and set the thumbnails. Design can be square or rounded, and you can set the size of the swatch. Interestin option is to activate `Show labels`. That way colors will not be shown as inline swatches, but more like a block list of thumbnails with their names. Also, ratio of the image is respected, so if the images are 100x50px they will appear in 2:1 ratio and not square.

:::tip
Use small resolution images here. Anything like 64x64px, 128x128px and similar works.
