# How to turn ON the Adoptive Filtering?

Each preset can have it's own adoptive filtering settings. This means that, if you use perhaps multiple filter presets for categories, you will be able to set some of those to use the adoptive filtering and some of those not to your liking.

**To turn on the adoptive filterign on a preset do the following:**

1. Navigate `Product Filter` settings page
2. Select the `Filter Preset` tab
3. Select a preset you wish to use the adoptive filtering in the `Filter Presets` option
4. Under `Filter Options` click the `Adoptive` tab
5. The `Enable` option should be set to `ON` (green color, knob set on right)
6. Now, there are many configurations on how to do it and we would now just continue to the option where for example product tags will adjust to filtered criteria and after explaining that, we'll go back to the adoptive options and principles to make things more smoother
7. Once activated you'd need to activate it for a particular filter, in our example, this will be the product tags filter
8. Go back and click the `Filters` tab under `Filter Options`
9. Expand the filter you want to have the adoptive filtering tuned on
10. This is done by clicking the `+` icon on the filter
11. Now set the option `Adoptive`
12. There are more options to choose from for each filter, you can set it to `Not active on this filter` (default), `Terms will be hidden` - this one will hide the terms from display, `Terms will be shown, but unclickable` - this will show the terms, however they won't be clikable and will display as disabled, faded, `Terms will be shown and clickable` - this one makes them look faded, but they are still shown and clickable, these will then lead to no products found pages

**That's about it! Now set it for every filter card you need.**

:::tip
If you want to reorder the terms, so that only terms that are avaialble to be on top, this is only avaiable for `Terms will be shown, but unclickable` and `Terms will be shown and clickable` options, you'd go back to the `Adoptive` tab and you would activate the `Reorder Terms` option. This one is currently only available global for a preset and cannot be set to a filter card independantly.
