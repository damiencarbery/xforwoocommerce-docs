Envato Market, our official seller, sends you an email notification each time we release an update.

When an update is released for any plugin that is active in your WordPress website a suggestion is that you should update immediately.

**We strongly suggest to do this with our plugins as well!**

There are a couple of ways to update our plugins.

1. Automated updates
2. Manual updating

## Automated updates

To achieve automated plugin updates on any Envato Market item, install and activate the Envato Market plugin.

1. Download [**Envato Market plugin here**](https://envato.com/market-plugin/)
2. Install and activate the plugin. `Envato Market` section will appear in your WordPress admin screen
3. Navigate the `Envato Market` page and there find the instructions on how to activate the Envato API
4. You need to generate your personal Envato token and then enter it in the token field
5. Follow those steps and click the `Save` button. Once done, plugin, or your website, is connected with the Envato platform
5. Once the plugin is active and running, you will get the information about the updates and you will be able to update from the dashboard iteself, even automatically!

## Manual updating

If automated updates don't work for you, update the manual way.

Plugins are updated as any other, you deactivate and remove the plugin from the website and then you install the new version.

There's no need to worry about the options and configuration as it is kept in the database.

1. Download the newest version from the [**Codecanyon downloads page**](https://codecanyon.net/downloads)
2. You'll need to be logged in with the account you've purchased an item with. On the `Downloads` page find the item you're updating
3. Download the full plugin .ZIP archive
4. Unzip it on your computer to reveal the plugin .ZIP archive
5. Navigate your website `Plugins` screen
6. Deactivate and remove the plugin you want to update
7. Don't worry about the options and configuration, it is kept in the database
8. Now, click the `Add New Plugin` button and then click the `Upload Plugin` button
9. Upload the .ZIP plugin archive that was revealed when the full plugin archive was unzipped
10. Once uploaded, click the `Activate` button

## Checklist to complete after updates

**Make sure to complete this checklist after updating plugins to avoid potential troubles and problems.**

1. Visit the [Blog](/blog) to read the lastest change log
2. Read all change logs on the missed versions and consider what's said there when updating
3. After a completed update clear your browser cache
4. If you use WordPress caching plugins clear their cache as well
5. If you use JS/CSS minification plugins make sure to clear their cache too
