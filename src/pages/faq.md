# Frequently asked questions

### Q: Where's my plugin zip archive?

**A:** Any items you purchase from Envato Market CodeCanyon you can find here https://codecanyon.net/downloads in your CodeCanyon Downloads section. There you can download any plugin archive you've purchased including ours. Make sure you're using the plugin archive, as sometimes you download the complete package and the plugin archive needs to be extracted from it.
