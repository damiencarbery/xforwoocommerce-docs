The changes made in this big update are explained in this blog post.

**XforWooCommerce 2.0 June 20, 2023.**

All XforWooCommerce code was washed with a PHPCodeSniffer on WordPress-Core standards and all noteable errors were fixed.

This means that the items are more reliable than ever and are again checked for errors on all sides and with many integrations.

The Demo installation is now running **WordPress 6.2.2, WooCommerce 7.8.0 and XforWooCommerce 2.0.0**.

Our servers run **VestaCP NGINX, PHP 8**.

### Product Filter 9.0.0
- fixed array_unique problems for terms selection
- fixed thumbnail size bug

### Product Badges 5.0.0
- added shortcode support to detect when in the product loop
